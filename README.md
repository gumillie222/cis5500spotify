When finding concerts, oftentimes finding accommodation nearby can be time-consuming. We thus seek to ease this process in our application by showing the concerts and Airbnbs in the same city specifically in 2020. Our users can then search up these concerts + Airbnbs either by city through an interactive map or by searching up the artist’s name and city.

When a user clicks a city on a provided interactive map of the United States, our application will be able to provide concerts performed by artists that have ranked on a Spotify Top 200 Chart in 2020 as well as nearby Airbnb listings and some information about these. Furthermore, each concert will include a short description of the artist based on their highest-ranking songs (e.g. “You may know this artist from their song <insert song here>”). Similarly, if the user chooses to search up an artist as well as a city, then if there is a concert by that artist in the provided city, a list of Airbnbs will be given (else, a message will appear.
